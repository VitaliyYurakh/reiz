    "faq": {
      "group1_item1_answer": "Lviv has many paid zones and municipal parking lots. Always park within marked lines or in guarded parking areas, check road signs and parking meters, and keep receipts. Improper parking results in fines paid by the renter. In areas with limited parking, use shopping mall or hotel parking. It is useful to install city apps for parking payment and zone navigation. Before leaving the car overnight, check local courtyard/street rules to avoid towing.",
      "group1_item1_question": "Where to park a rental car in Lviv and how to avoid fines?",
      "group1_item2_answer": "We provide delivery/return to any address in Lviv and meet you at the LWO terminal at the agreed time. Extra charges may apply for early/late hours and waiting time, final price depends on distance. Intercity delivery across Ukraine is also available on request. To ensure timely service, book in advance and provide your flight/hotel details. Want to speed up the process? Book online at REIZ Rental Cars — it’s more convenient and locks in your rate.",
      "group1_item2_question": "Car delivery to an address and Lviv Airport (LWO): conditions and prices",
      "group1_item3_answer": "A daily mileage limit applies (usually 250–300 km/day), which is enough for business and tourist routes around Lviv and the region. For longer trips (e.g., Lviv–Kyiv or Lviv–Odesa), add the extended or unlimited mileage option when booking. Exceeding the limit is charged at a fixed rate per kilometer according to tariffs. Inform us about your route in advance — we’ll suggest the best option and where to refuel along the way.",
      "group1_item3_question": "Is there a mileage limit and how to book a trip across Ukraine without restrictions?",
      "group1_pretitle": "Practical Information",
      "group2_item1_answer": "Rental includes mandatory liability insurance and standard Casco with a deductible. Liability covers third-party damages, Casco covers damage to the rental car above the deductible. Certain cases (e.g., glass/tires) may have special conditions — clarify during booking in the “Insurance” section. In case of an accident, record the incident and call the authorities immediately. Extended coverage reduces your risks and helps close cases faster.",
      "group2_item1_question": "What does insurance cover and how does it help on the road? (Liability/Casco)",
      "group2_item2_answer": "The deductible is the maximum amount you pay in case of damage; insurance covers the rest. The deposit is the amount blocked on your card during the rental, usually equal to the deductible. Example: damage = 50,000 UAH, deductible/deposit = 20,000 UAH — your responsibility is 20,000 UAH, the rest is covered by insurance. The deposit is released after returning the car undamaged; release time depends on the bank and usually takes a few days.",
      "group2_item2_question": "Deductible vs. deposit: what’s the difference and how much do you risk?",
      "group2_item3_answer": "Renting without a deposit is not possible.<p>By default, a deposit equal to the deductible is blocked (depends on car class). You may reduce your responsibility by choosing:</p><ul><li>−50% deposit/deductible (CDW);</li><li>−100% deposit/“zero liability” (SCDW) for damage/theft.</li></ul><p><span class=\"text-strong\">Important:</span> even with “zero liability” there is a mandatory hold of <span class=\"text-strong\">$200–300</span> (depending on model) for:</p><ul><li>fines and tolls,</li><li>missing fuel,</li><li>car wash/interior cleaning,</li><li>lost keys.</li></ul><p>This hold is not for damages and is refunded after clearing possible charges. Choose the right package when booking — we’ll suggest the best option for rentals in Lviv and trips across Ukraine.</p>",

      "group2_pretitle": "Insurance and Deposit",
      "group3_item1_answer": "Basic requirements: from 21 years old with at least 2 years of driving experience. For business/premium cars: 23–25 years old and at least 5 years of experience. If you don’t fully meet the requirements, a “young driver” program is available for an extra fee. All drivers must be listed in the rental agreement: prepare documents and provide additional driver details in advance to avoid refusal at pickup.",
      "group3_item1_question": "Minimum age and driving experience for renting in Lviv and Ukraine",
      "group3_item2_answer": "Driving within Ukraine is unrestricted, but leaving the country is possible only with company’s written permission and a “Green Card” insurance. Time is needed for processing and checking the route/borders. Crossing borders without approval is prohibited, voids insurance, and leads to penalties. Planning a foreign trip? Inform us in advance — we’ll check requirements, prepare documents, and advise on timing.",
      "group3_item2_question": "Can I drive outside Ukraine with a rental car?",
      "group3_item3_answer": "Only drivers listed in the contract are allowed to drive the car. Passing the car to third parties, using it for taxi, carsharing, or courier services is prohibited and voids insurance. Need a second driver? Add them to the contract — it’s legal and safe. Violations result in contractual fines and full financial liability in case of an incident.",
      "group3_item3_question": "Giving the car to third parties and using it for taxi/carsharing: what is prohibited",
      "group3_pretitle": "Restrictions and Prohibitions",
      "group4_item1_answer": "We accept payments in cash (UAH, USD, EUR), Visa/Mastercard cards, bank transfer, and — upon prior agreement — cryptocurrency (USDT/USDC). Currency/crypto payments follow the company’s rate at the time of transaction; bank and network fees may apply. Payments are available in Lviv and for delivery across Ukraine. The deposit is blocked on the renter’s card at pickup and released after returning the car undamaged. Release time depends on the bank (usually a few business days). For companies — invoices and closing documents are provided.",
      "group4_item1_question": "What payment methods are available and how is the deposit taken?",
      "group4_item2_answer": "Required: passport/ID card, driver’s license category B (at least 2 years), and a bank card in the renter’s name. Foreign citizens are advised to have an International Driving Permit (IDP) along with their national license — this makes verification easier. If planning a rental in Lviv during weekends or holidays, book in advance — document checks are faster and car selection is wider (see “Restrictions and Prohibitions”).",
      "group4_item2_question": "What documents are required for renting in Lviv: locals and foreigners?",
      "group4_item3_answer": "Cars are provided with a full tank and must be returned refueled to full. If not, missing fuel and a refueling service fee are charged at company rates. Refuel before return, keep the receipt — this avoids questions at handover. For those planning active trips around Lviv with early departures/late returns, plan your refueling and timing in advance.",
