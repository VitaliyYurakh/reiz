      "text": "<div class='editor_text'>At REIZ, we don't just hand over keys; we ensure your mobility. We offer seamless car delivery across Lviv and can transport vehicles to any location in Ukraine upon request.<br/><br/>Our fleet is curated to meet every need: prestigious <span class='text-strong'>premium</span> models for business, rugged <span class='text-strong'>SUVs</span> for mountain adventures, and spacious <span class='text-strong'>minivans</span> for family trips. Even if you're looking for an <span class='text-strong'>economy option</span>, we prioritize newer models that offer a level of comfort and safety well above the standard.</div><h2 class='editor_title'>Rental Plans: Choose Your Pace</h2><h3 class='editor_title'>The Daily Drive: Try Before You Commit</h3><div class='editor_text'>The daily rate is the perfect low-pressure test drive. Take a car for 24 hours to see how it handles Lviv's cobblestones or the highway. Is parking easy? Do your suitcases fit? Do you love the sound of the engine? One day is usually enough to decide whether to extend for a month or switch to a different class. Many of our clients grab a car for a day just to test it before a weekend trip to the Carpathians - the steep climbs to Slavske or the winding roads to Bukovel will quickly tell you if it's the right ride for your holiday.</div><h3 class='editor_title'>The Weekly Getaway</h3><div class='editor_text'>A weekly rental offers the best balance of price and freedom. One fixed rate, seven days, and zero waiting for taxis. A week gives you the flexibility to mix city business with leisure: explore the castles of the Lviv region, tour the wine roads, or head into the mountains. It gives you more time to get comfortable with the car than a daily rental, and extending your booking is simple if you decide to stay longer.</div><h3 class='editor_title'>Monthly Rental: The Long-Stay Solution</h3><div class='editor_text'>Perfect for projects, business trips, or relocation. You get a significantly lower daily rate and a single, predictable payment. This format is designed for regular business travel: Lviv to Kyiv commutes, or client visits in Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Rivne. One car covers everything - office runs, meetings, moving boxes, or picking up partners. Plans changed? Extending the term or swapping the car is hassle-free.</div><h3 class='editor_title'>Long-Term Subscription (3+ Months)</h3><div class='editor_text'>Forget the hassle of buying, selling, or maintaining a vehicle. Long-term rental (3 to 12+ months) gives you a personal car with a fixed monthly budget. It's convenient and economical. You have a car ready for daily tasks and intercity travel without worrying about depreciation or service costs. It allows you to plan your budget months ahead, and if your needs change - say, you need an SUV for winter instead of a sedan - we can swap the model.</div><h2 class='editor_title'>🚀 Coming Soon: Economy Class</h2><div class='editor_text'>We heard you, and we're expanding! Very soon, we will open bookings for economical, maneuverable cars starting from just $20/day. Want to be the first to know? Leave a request, and we'll notify you as soon as the Economy fleet is ready. In the meantime, check out our Comfort Class special offers - you might find a higher level of safety and features for a price that surprises you.</div><h2 class='editor_title'>Why Choose REIZ?</h2><div class='editor_text'><ul><li>Seamless Booking: Our website is built for humans - fast filters, real photos, and accurate specs.</li><li>Instant Processing: We respect your time; booking takes just a couple of minutes.</li><li>Flexible Delivery: We bring the car to you - LWO Airport, the train station, your hotel, or any address in the city.</li><li>No Hidden Fees: The price you see is the price you pay. No surprises at checkout.</li><li>Total Flexibility: Need to extend? Want to swap cars? We make it easy.</li><li>Reliable Fleet: We are obsessive about maintenance. Clean interiors, timely service, and seasonal tires are non-negotiable.</li><li>24/7 Support: Real people, ready to help in UA, EN, RU, or HE.</li><li>Ukraine-Wide: We don't just stop at the city limits. Intercity delivery and returns are available on request.</li></ul></div><h2 class='editor_title'>Additional Services</h2><h3 class='editor_title'>No Deposit / Reduced Deposit</h3><div class='editor_text'>We know a massive deposit isn't always convenient. We offer rental options without a deposit or with a 50% reduction for specific models. Eligibility depends on your driving experience and the car class - you'll see all the details clearly during booking.</div><h3 class='editor_title'>Chauffeur Service</h3><div class='editor_text'>Want the comfort without the driving? Book a car with a professional driver. We'll handle the airport transfer, hotel drop-off, or business logistics while you relax.</div><h3 class='editor_title'>Delivery & Return</h3><div class='editor_text'>In Lviv: Free. We deliver to the center, any district, the railway station, or the airport at no extra cost (client only covers airport parking).<br/>Outside Lviv: Calculated based on mileage. We can deliver anywhere in Ukraine.<br/>Returns: Free within city limits.</div><h3 class='editor_title'>Useful Add-ons</h3><div class='editor_text'><ul><li>Navigation: All cars feature Apple CarPlay & Android Auto. Just plug in your phone and use your favorite maps.</li><li>Child Seats: Available upon request for all ages.</li><li>Crossing Borders: Possible with prior approval (we handle the documents and insurance).</li><li>Unlimited Mileage: Available for many models - check the \"Unlimited\" tag when booking.</li></ul></div><h3 class='editor_title'>Condition: Pristine & Ready</h3><div class='editor_text'>We take pride in the condition of our fleet. Your safety is our obsession.<br/><br/>Pre-Drive Check: Brakes, lights, tire pressure, fluids - every car goes through a strict checklist before it reaches you.<br/><br/>Cleanliness: We deliver cars fresh. Dry/wet cleaning of the interior and a washed body are standard. Deep cleaning is performed whenever necessary.<br/><br/>Maintenance: We stick to the schedule. Genuine parts, partner service centers, and zero delays on maintenance.</div><h2 class='editor_title'>Safety Tips for the Road</h2><div class='editor_text'>Once you're in the driver's seat, safety is in your hands. Here are a few friendly reminders to keep your trip smooth:</div><h3 class='editor_title'>The 3-Second Rule</h3><div class='editor_text'>Keep your distance. Pick a landmark (a sign or pole) on the road. When the car ahead passes it, count \"one-two-three.\" If you pass the mark before you finish counting, back off a bit. That gap is your reaction time.</div><h3 class='editor_title'>Lane Changes</h3><div class='editor_text'><ul><li>Check Blind Spots: Mirrors are great, but a quick glance over your shoulder is better.</li><li>Signal Early: Let others know what you're doing before you start turning the wheel.</li><li>Be Smooth: One maneuver, one lane. Don't dart across multiple lanes at once.</li><li>Watch for Two Wheels: Scooters and motorcycles can easily hide in your blind spots.</li></ul></div><h3 class='editor_title'>Read the Signs</h3><div class='editor_text'>Traffic signs are the language of the road. If a junction looks confusing or you miss a sign, it's better to slow down and figure it out than to rush.</div><h3 class='editor_title'>Zero Tolerance</h3><div class='editor_text'>We are strict on this: Driving under the influence is prohibited. REIZ adheres to a zero-tolerance policy regarding alcohol. It's about your safety and the safety of everyone around you.</div>",

    "faq": {
      "group1_item1_answer": "Lviv has many paid zones and municipal parking lots. Always park within marked lines or in guarded parking areas, check road signs and parking meters, and keep receipts. Improper parking results in fines paid by the renter. In areas with limited parking, use shopping mall or hotel parking. It is useful to install city apps for parking payment and zone navigation. Before leaving the car overnight, check local courtyard/street rules to avoid towing.",
      "group1_item1_question": "Where to park a rental car in Lviv and how to avoid fines?",
      "group1_item2_answer": "We provide delivery/return to any address in Lviv and meet you at the LWO terminal at the agreed time. Extra charges may apply for early/late hours and waiting time, final price depends on distance. Intercity delivery across Ukraine is also available on request. To ensure timely service, book in advance and provide your flight/hotel details. Want to speed up the process? Book online at REIZ Rental Cars — it’s more convenient and locks in your rate.",
      "group1_item2_question": "Car delivery to an address and Lviv Airport (LWO): conditions and prices",
      "group1_item3_answer": "A daily mileage limit applies (usually 250–300 km/day), which is enough for business and tourist routes around Lviv and the region. For longer trips (e.g., Lviv–Kyiv or Lviv–Odesa), add the extended or unlimited mileage option when booking. Exceeding the limit is charged at a fixed rate per kilometer according to tariffs. Inform us about your route in advance — we’ll suggest the best option and where to refuel along the way.",
      "group1_item3_question": "Is there a mileage limit and how to book a trip across Ukraine without restrictions?",
      "group1_pretitle": "Practical Information",
      "group2_item1_answer": "Rental includes mandatory liability insurance and standard Casco with a deductible. Liability covers third-party damages, Casco covers damage to the rental car above the deductible. Certain cases (e.g., glass/tires) may have special conditions — clarify during booking in the “Insurance” section. In case of an accident, record the incident and call the authorities immediately. Extended coverage reduces your risks and helps close cases faster.",
      "group2_item1_question": "What does insurance cover and how does it help on the road? (Liability/Casco)",
      "group2_item2_answer": "The deductible is the maximum amount you pay in case of damage; insurance covers the rest. The deposit is the amount blocked on your card during the rental, usually equal to the deductible. Example: damage = 50,000 UAH, deductible/deposit = 20,000 UAH — your responsibility is 20,000 UAH, the rest is covered by insurance. The deposit is released after returning the car undamaged; release time depends on the bank and usually takes a few days.",
      "group2_item2_question": "Deductible vs. deposit: what’s the difference and how much do you risk?",
      "group2_item3_answer": "Renting without a deposit is not possible.<p>By default, a deposit equal to the deductible is blocked (depends on car class). You may reduce your responsibility by choosing:</p><ul><li>−50% deposit/deductible (CDW);</li><li>−100% deposit/“zero liability” (SCDW) for damage/theft.</li></ul><p><span class=\"text-strong\">Important:</span> even with “zero liability” there is a mandatory hold of <span class=\"text-strong\">$200–300</span> (depending on model) for:</p><ul><li>fines and tolls,</li><li>missing fuel,</li><li>car wash/interior cleaning,</li><li>lost keys.</li></ul><p>This hold is not for damages and is refunded after clearing possible charges. Choose the right package when booking — we’ll suggest the best option for rentals in Lviv and trips across Ukraine.</p>",
      "group2_item3_question": "Can I rent without a deposit and how does “zero liability” work?",
      "group2_pretitle": "Insurance and Deposit",
      "group3_item1_answer": "Basic requirements: from 21 years old with at least 2 years of driving experience. For business/premium cars: 23–25 years old and at least 5 years of experience. If you don’t fully meet the requirements, a “young driver” program is available for an extra fee. All drivers must be listed in the rental agreement: prepare documents and provide additional driver details in advance to avoid refusal at pickup.",
      "group3_item1_question": "Minimum age and driving experience for renting in Lviv and Ukraine",
      "group3_item2_answer": "Driving within Ukraine is unrestricted, but leaving the country is possible only with company’s written permission and a “Green Card” insurance. Time is needed for processing and checking the route/borders. Crossing borders without approval is prohibited, voids insurance, and leads to penalties. Planning a foreign trip? Inform us in advance — we’ll check requirements, prepare documents, and advise on timing.",
      "group3_item2_question": "Can I drive outside Ukraine with a rental car?",
      "group3_item3_answer": "Only drivers listed in the contract are allowed to drive the car. Passing the car to third parties, using it for taxi, carsharing, or courier services is prohibited and voids insurance. Need a second driver? Add them to the contract — it’s legal and safe. Violations result in contractual fines and full financial liability in case of an incident.",
      "group3_item3_question": "Giving the car to third parties and using it for taxi/carsharing: what is prohibited",
      "group3_pretitle": "Restrictions and Prohibitions",
      "group4_item1_answer": "We accept payments in cash (UAH, USD, EUR), Visa/Mastercard cards, bank transfer, and — upon prior agreement — cryptocurrency (USDT/USDC). Currency/crypto payments follow the company’s rate at the time of transaction; bank and network fees may apply. Payments are available in Lviv and for delivery across Ukraine. The deposit is blocked on the renter’s card at pickup and released after returning the car undamaged. Release time depends on the bank (usually a few business days). For companies — invoices and closing documents are provided.",
      "group4_item1_question": "What payment methods are available and how is the deposit taken?",
      "group4_item2_answer": "Required: passport/ID card, driver’s license category B (at least 2 years), and a bank card in the renter’s name. Foreign citizens are advised to have an International Driving Permit (IDP) along with their national license — this makes verification easier. If planning a rental in Lviv during weekends or holidays, book in advance — document checks are faster and car selection is wider (see “Restrictions and Prohibitions”).",
      "group4_item2_question": "What documents are required for renting in Lviv: locals and foreigners?",
      "group4_item3_answer": "Cars are provided with a full tank and must be returned refueled to full. If not, missing fuel and a refueling service fee are charged at company rates. Refuel before return, keep the receipt — this avoids questions at handover.

        "why_car": "Why you need a car here: The car trunk is your mobile dressing room. To take diverse photos (in a flowing dress at the palace and casual style on the fortress walls), you need to carry spare clothes.",

        "rental_text": "This is an easy route. The road is excellent (M-06 highway), castles are close. Plan: Pick up the car in the morning, arrive at the castles by lunch, return the car to Lviv in the evening. No point in paying for a second day.",
